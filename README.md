# fico-analyzer
•	Engineered a quantization technique to strategically bucket FICO scores into credit ratings for input into a machine learning model.
•	Applied statistical optimization methods (e.g., minimizing mean squared error/log-likelihood) to define data-driven FICO bucket boundaries.
•	Developed a scalable Python solution to generalize across datasets with varying distributions and bucket requirements.
•	Mapped continuous FICO scores into categorical ratings, enabling model compatibility while preserving predictive power for default risk.
•	Enhanced the mortgage PD model’s robustness, allowing the risk team to analyze and act on segmented borrower risk profiles.
•	Supported long-term model scalability, ensuring adaptability to future datasets and evolving credit evaluation needs.
